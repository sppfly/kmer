# k-mer Extractor from Automaton

This project provides a simple C++ tool for extracting all valid `k`-mers from the language of a labeled automaton. It supports multiple values of `k`, branching paths, and correctness tests.

---

## What It Does

Given an automaton represented as labeled transitions over the DNA alphabet `{A, C, G, T}`, the program traverses all valid paths from the initial state and extracts every substring of length `k` from those paths (i.e., all valid `k`-mers).

## How to Compile

To compile this project, you need `make` and `g++` supports c++20. The code is compiled and tested on `OpenSUSE Slowroll`.

This project uses a `Makefile`. To build:

```bash
make
```

This will compile all source files into a single binary called main.

To clean up:

```bash
make clean
```

## How to Run

After building, simply run the test suite:

```

./main
```

You should see output like this:

```
------test_simple------
✅PASS
------test_single_diverge------
✅PASS
...
------test_long_random_sequence------
✅PASS
```

Each test checks a different automaton structure and compares output to expected k-mers.

## Project Structure

| File               | Purpose                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `main.cpp`         | Test entry point                      |
| `kmer.hpp/.cpp`    | Core k-mer extraction logic           |
| `test.hpp/.cpp`    | Test cases for functional correctness |
| `gentest.hpp/.cpp` | Test cases generated by AI            |
| `Makefile`         | Build script                          |

## Example Test Cases

Some of the test cases include:

    Linear DNA paths like ACGCTG

    Branching paths like ACTGTG and ACTCTG

    Long randomized DNA sequences (length 1000) to test performance and correctness

## Attribution

Some parts of this project (such as the Makefile structure and test cases in `gentest.cpp`) were generated or assisted by AI (ChatGPT). However, I make sure that I understand all the tests and am fully responsible for the design, implementation, and correctness of the entire codebase.
